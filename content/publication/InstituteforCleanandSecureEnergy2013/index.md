abstract = """The Clean and Secure Energy from Domestic Oil Shale and Oil Sands Resources Program has completed a study that seeks to assess significant impediments to and impacts of development of U.S. oil shale and oil sands resources. It focuses on three specific questions within the context of potential development in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah:

* What positive and negative externalities and non-market costs are associated with development of these resources and how does the perception of these costs impact development?
* What is the per barrel cost of oil produced from four oil shale and oil sands development scenarios?
* What are the broad regional impacts that may result as side effects if the scenarios are realized?

The study was completed by a team of researchers in the Institute for Clean & Secure Energy at the University of Utah with additional help from local and regional scientists, engineers, and economists."""
